			<h4 id="intro">Intro</h4>
			<p>For many years now I&#39;ve been trying to become a social-media minimalist in the hope that it quells the anxieties I get from being perceived on the net. But in that action, don&#39;t I become a digital voyeur who never reveals himself to my online community? The internet allows me to fulfill many of my intellectual and social needs that my environment alone could not meet. Yet in the same way, the internet cannot provide all my social needs as it presents itself to be able to. Humans have an innate desire to communicate and be heard. When I become a digital hermit and seclude myself from many aspects of the digital world that people come to it for, what kind of catch-22 am I stuck in?</p>
	<h4 id="long-time-reader-first-time-poster">Long time reader, first time poster</h4>
	<p>After doing a little <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/">research</a>, I found out that only 10% of people in online communities participate actively, with only 1% of those users being heavy contributors. That means that 90% of people are lurking just like me. I found this to be pretty incredible because from the &quot;outside&quot; the web seems so alive and ready to be interacted with. Could such a rule really apply to social media services like Twitter or Snapchat? A 2019 study on Twitter shows that this percentage of lurkers may be closer to 3 to 4, about 75% lurkers. 
	What is also interesting to me is how many studies were done on lurkers through the lens of them being leeches on online communities. </p>
	<p>I can kind of see how it could happen on a platform like Meta (formerly Facebook), where CEO Mark Zuckerburg in a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/mark-zuckerberg-doesnt-like-your-scrolling-habits-social-media-is-for-building-relationships-not-just-consuming-content/ar-AA11s1Nb">podcast talked about</a> the scrolling habits of Facebook users.  It&#39;s always a chilling moment when I find myself having a common opinion with Zuckerberg but it&#39;s odd how the problem I am trying to overcome is one he sees on mass scale on his platform. I also find it funny how Facebook today is the antithesis of what he wants from his users. So I guess then the question becomes: where do I congregate where I feel safe and unexploited? </p>
	<p>Then the question comes to me, why is my participation in these online platforms so essential to their being? There is much research done about lurking and online community participation. </p>
	<h4 id="perception-and-anxiety">Perception and anxiety</h4>
	<p>For a long time now I have been living with and managing anxiety that mainly stems from social settings. 
	When I was younger this fear did not extend to the online realm and was in fact an outlet for me to express my thoughts and opinions without being openly critiqued... to my face at least. I found community in sites like <a href="https://www.gaiaonline.com/">gaiaonline</a> and <a href="https://www.neopets.com/">neopets</a> when i was younger and then eventually to myspace and then tumblr as spaces where I would congregate to find out and talk to those in my life that I knew. With tumblr, many of the friends I made I&#39;ve never met and eventually lost all contact with save a few. Growing up online instilled me with a sense of distrust for those around me on the internet. However for all the foresight I lacked when it came to some of the decisions I made online and the people I talked to I made up in pure childish naïveté.</p>
	<h4 id="breaking-free-from-the-fear">Breaking free from the fear</h4>
	<p>What would it take me to get out of my shell and post regularly in an online community rather than just browsing? What makes me feel like my opinion, no matter how mundane, is not worth contributing? 
	The only social media platform I regularly post on now is Twitter to my seventy-something followers and it is helping me grow out of my shell again slowly. I have this mental block when it comes to posting in forums or online communities now as if it is an equivalence to public speaking. For example I recently needed help trying to troubleshoot something on my website where my footer was giving me issues, and for the life of me asking for help was the last thing I did once I couldn&#39;t figure it out. </p>
	<p>I feel like a lot of it also has to do with my relationship with the world around me. In many ways I have distanced or alienated myself from many aspects of life that people find comfort and community. This kind of attitude has to transfer to my online habits as well, doesn&#39;t it? </p>
	<p>At the same time a lot of my online practices involves being privacy-minded. In this day and age of us being the product or rather we provide the product with our data that is collected. 
	We convince ourselves that our input is not needed in a conversation. Sometimes it has already been stated and you have nothing to add or you feel like what you have to say is irrelevant to the conversation. Some people are just shy and simply do not have enough confidence to post onto the web, openly stating their opinions proudly or not.
	Lately I feel like I&#39;m not even lurking on the web anymore. I&#39;m just a passive receiver of posts from the social-media platforms I frequent. Gone is the daily sense of wonder and curiosity I used to feel when starting up my computer and getting online. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s gone completely. Recently I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webrings</a> and I&#39;ve been having a blast going through link after link of sites that have loose association in theme or content, but creativity binds them all. I get reminded by the countless hours I spent on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StumbleUpon">StumbleUpon</a> discovering countless categories of content, never staying put on one place on the net but always feeling like I had a steady footing. Now it feels like the opposite is true: I am only on a few sites regularly but my presence online does not feel stable or appetizing. </p>
	<h4 id="accepting-help">Accepting Help</h4>
	<p>The reality is that there is an overwhelming amount of people on the web, both lurkers and posters, who are willing to help strangers with a myriad of things, from technical to nontechnical. These people do it without the want for anything in return simply because they gain something from helping or discussing.</p>
	<h4 id="building-a-better-web">Building a Better Web</h4>
	<p>The web is inherently a social place that will only be a vacuum without content and people to interact with it. That puts interaction into two camps: content interaction which is a relatively solitary endeavor and community interaction which inherently involves both parties. 
	Community is not built alone. It involves groups of people interacting in multiple kinds of ways to hopefully grow and facilitate something new, and better for the world.</p>
	<p>My question lately though is: how do i develop the courage and bravery to branch back out into the digital space as an authentic me? It sounds like such a silly question, not only because people are constantly themselves online... but also because what exactly is wrong with crafting a persona online of who you are closer to wanting to become? </p>
